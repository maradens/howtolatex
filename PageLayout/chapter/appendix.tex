\chapter{Information About Appendix}
In writing, an appendix is used to provide supplementary information that supports the main text but would be distracting if included within the main body. This can include raw data, detailed explanations, technical notes, or additional resources. Appendices are typically placed at the end of a document and are referenced within the main text to guide readers to the additional information.

An appendix is a section at the end of your main document that contains supplementary information such as figures, tables, raw data, code, etc. The appendix can also be structured in chapters (which are often considered to be multiple appendices), which are usually numbered with capital letters, instead of Arabic numbers.
